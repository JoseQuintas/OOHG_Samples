This repository contains samples, programs and apps for Windows developed using (x)Harbour and [Object Oriented Harbour GUI (aka OOHG)](https://github.com/oohg/core).

Please follow this general guidelines for publishing samples:

* Always credit the authors and contributors.
* Always state the type of license that applies to the code (we recommend [The Code Project Open License version 1.02](https://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx)).
* If your sample needs third party files, state so and include a working link to them.
* Although you can use any language, try to write in English because ooHG is used worldwide.
* Include as many comments as needed to make the sample comprehensible.
